# How they are layed out

Scenarios are layed out in a .ini file. They are read using configparser.
Scenarios consist of 2 Sections:
    - Main: Stores vars like the question
    - Option[x]: Stores option specific vars

# What the values mean

[Main]
The 'Question' value is used to print the question
The 'NumberOfOptions' value is used to help specify the number of options
The 'Option[Number]' value is the option that is printed to the user

[OptionX]
The 'StatChanges' value is used to store the stat changes for this option
The 'Random' boolean is used to check whether randomness should be applied - See Randomness
The 'FollowOnScenario' value is used to specify if anotther senario should immedially take place
The 'AfterMessage' value is the after message displayed if this option is selected
    - 'FollowOnScenario' and 'AfterMessage' are turned of by putting: none

# Randomness

Randomness works by getting a number between 1 and 10
It then compares this to 'RandomNumber'
It does this like: if Generatednumber > RandomNumber
If that is true it uses the vars with the 1 infront
Else it uses the ones with 2
